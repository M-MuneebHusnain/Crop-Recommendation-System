# Crop-Recommendation-System
This project provides a machine learning-based system for recommending suitable crops based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH level of soil, and rainfall. The system utilizes a dataset containing information about different crops and their requirements, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) content. The machine learning model used for crop recommendation is a Logistic Regression classifier. The model is trained on the dataset to predict the suitable crop based on the input environmental factors.
